DSA Data Access for Vetted Researchers
======================================

Under the EU Digital Services Act (**DSA**), vetted researchers that meet the independence and security requirements set out in the regulation may request access, via the European Commission’s DSA Data Access Portal, to X’s data for the sole purpose of conducting research that contributes to the detection, identification and understanding of systemic risks in the Union, and to the assessment of the adequacy, efficiency and impacts of the risk mitigation measures.

This page provides information for vetted researchers on the data assets, their data structure and metadata, to which they may request access pursuant to Article 40(4) of the DSA, as well as the suggested data access modalities.

Vetted Researchers Data Access Requests
---------------------------------------

Under the DSA and the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2025/2050 of 1 July 2025, vetted researchers’ applications and data access requests under DSA Article 40(4) must be submitted through the dedicated [DSA Data Access Portal](https://data-access.dsa.ec.europa.eu/home).

Data access applications under DSA Article 40(12) can be submitted through the following [X DSA Researcher Application Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdo0O-D6Kxa3cV4g1JLz2T_0Sk3hdEnTdv8dJmibagCnzJ7kg/viewform).

Category

**Content Recommendations**

Description

Open source code on algorithmic recommendations, which serves content across all product surfaces (e.g., For You, Explore, Notifications, Search, etc.). Repository allows researchers to review the actual infrastructure driving content recommendation for all users without compromising user safety and privacy (which requires protecting model weights and training data). This provides researchers the opportunity to understand how user engagement data feeds into the recommendation system and the machinations of that system to then source and recommend a certain pool of content.  

More information on X’s content recommendation system can be found [here](https://help.x.com/resources/recommender-systems) and [here](https://github.com/twitter/the-algorithm?tab=readme-ov-file#xs-recommendation-algorithm).

Data Access Modalities
----------------------

The data access modalities should be adequate to address the sensitivity of the specific data requested in a data access application and appropriate to fulfil the requirements of data security, data confidentiality and protection of personal data. 

To help vetted researchers better identify the appropriate modality, the table above outlines X’s suggested non-exhaustive access modalities for the data described in the DSA data catalogue. However, we note that other data access modalities may be more appropriate depending on the specific types of data ultimately requested by vetted researchers.

Depending on the relevant access modality, technical, organisational and/or legal conditions for access may be applicable, including, but not limited to: creation of a developer account by the researcher and programmatic retrieval (more information available at: [https://docs.x.com/overview)](https://docs.x.com/overview); enabling a secure environment via access controls; email and login information controls; acceptance of the [X Developer Agreement](https://developer.x.com/developer-terms/agreement-and-policy) and [X Developer Policy](https://developer.x.com/developer-terms/policy), which include specific provisions on accessing data for the purposes of DSA Art. 40; use of [batch compliance endpoints](https://docs.x.com/x-api/compliance/batch-compliance/introduction) tools to help researchers maintain X data in compliance with the [X Developer Agreement](https://developer.x.com/developer-terms/agreement) and [X Developer Policy](https://developer.x.com/developer-terms/policy); any security measures necessary for the vetted researcher to ensure confidentiality and security of personal data and non-personal data at all times; entering into non-disclosure agreements.
